# Software Engineering Immersive – Project 03

This was the third project on the General Assembly Sofware Engineering Immersive. It was a group project which took place over 9 days (week 9) and I worked with Jenny Judova, Paul Cooke and Lloyd Noone. 

# Allotted

Allotted is a web platform that allows people who grow their own produce to share their excess production with people in their community. 

## Brief


    - Build a full-stack application with backend and front-end using a MERN stack

    - Work with at least 3 models/schema that are related in some way 

    - Incorporate CRUD funtionality 

    - Consume one or more public APIs

    - Establish a user journey and wireframes that clearly show which elements are MVP (CRUD fucntionality) and which elements are bonus features

    - Deploy the project online
